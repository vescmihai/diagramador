# JointJS+ Database Application

Design and visualize information systems.

## Running the application

Demo requires `Node.js` and `npm`

```
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs the Webpack bundle. Resulted js files are being hosted by webpack-dev-server.

Due to Same-Origin policy implemented in the majority of browsers to prevent content from being accessed if the file exists on another domain, it is recommended to access the application through a **Web server**. The application might work only partially when viewed from a file-system location.
